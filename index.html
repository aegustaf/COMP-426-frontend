          <p>When it comes to developing websites, design can be a very fun aspect. But in reality we often don't want
            to spend hours writing CSS.
            Aspects of good design (consistent theming, mobile friendly, and good typography) are tedious to manage
            for every site. Not to mention
            that most people don't get them right in the first place. So we use these frameworks to do a lot of the
            leg work for us.

              <h1 class="title">Why CS</h1>
              <h5 class="subtitle has-text-grey">Words words words are important</h5>
              <p>When it comes to design and specifically typography (which is a massive part of web design), you
                want
                your content to be readable. This means that when someone looks at it, they intuitively know
                which text to read first, second, and third.
                If all of the text on the page was the same size, it would be difficult to know which
                information is the most important.</p>
              <p>Size is one key way in which typographers create hierarchy and guide their readers.
                Headings are usually large, sub-headings are smaller, and body type is smaller still.
                Size is not the only way to define hierarchy â€“ it can also be achieved with colour, spacing and
                weight.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
              <h1 class="title">Plan Early</h1>
              <h5 class="subtitle has-text-grey">Words words words are important</h5>
              <p>The term 'measure' describes the width of a text block. If you're seeking to achieve the optimum
                reading experience,
                it's clearly an important consideration. If your lines are too long, your reader can easily get
                lost,
                while a too-short measure breaks up the reading experience unnecessarily.</p>
              <p>
                There are a number of theories to help you define the ideal measure for your typography.
                One rule of thumb is that your lines should be 2-3 alphabets in length (so 52-78 characters,
                including spaces). Bulma's container class
                does this for us.</p>
